# Anki Templates
Having constantly lost my design files for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net), I decided to store them here. Provides some formatting for my Anki flashcards including colour highlighting. The latter being a constant topic for strong-opinionated discussions (ยก Verbs are blue and not red which is for nouns and adjectives are green !), so I added classes in a CSS file to allow easy formatting.

- Entire card templates can be found in the [`card-templates`](card-templates) directory. Each node template is in its own subdirectory.
- Single elements like conjugation tables in [`card-elements`](card-elements).
